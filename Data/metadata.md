#Metadata and Technical specifications 

### 1. Image Acquisition Equipment

The following unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and sensor payloads were used for remote sensing and image acquisition:
- DJI Phantom Series – Standard RGB imaging for orthophoto generation and general mapping.
- DJI Matrice 300 RTK (M300 RTK) – Versatile industrial drone platform supporting advanced sensor payloads.
- DJI Zenmuse L1 (LiDAR) – Integrated LiDAR sensor with RGB camera, ideal for generating high-resolution 3D point clouds and digital surface models (DSM).
- DJI Zenmuse H20T / WiRiS Pro – Multispectral and thermal imaging payloads used for temperature anomaly detection and vegetation health analysis.
- PPK/RTK (Post-Processed Kinematic / Real-Time Kinematic) – High-precision GNSS-based georeferencing to enhance spatial accuracy of imagery and 3D data.

### 2. In-Situ Environmental Sensor Suite

On-the-ground sensor stations were deployed to collect auxiliary environmental data:
- SenseBox System – Modular IoT-based environmental monitoring unit with the following attached sensors:
- Soil Moisture and Soil Temperature Sensors
- Ground-Level Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) Sensor
- Ambient Temperature and Relative Humidity Sensors
- Particulate Matter (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10) Sensor


These data were synchronized with aerial acquisition to support multi-sensor integration and validation of remote sensing observations.
