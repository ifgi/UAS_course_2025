## About
 
This repository documents the interdisciplinary work conducted as part of the renaturation project of the River Aa, coordinated by the Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi- Universität Münster), serving as a field-based laboratory for students in the MSc programs in Geoinformatics and Geospatial Technologies.

Over recent weeks, students have engaged in advanced methodologies involving environmental monitoring, remote sensing, and spatial analysis, structured around three main teams:

### Image Analysis Team

Our team analyzed the renaturation process using multi-source imagery and geospatial datasets, structured across four analytical domains:
	1.	Flood Modeling
	•	Integration of Sentinel-1 SAR and UAV data
	•	Semantic segmentation and water extent classification
	2.	Forest and River Change Detection
	•	Multitemporal analysis using NDVI, NDSI, and land cover dynamics
	3.	Vegetation Type Classification
	•	Spectral signatures from UAV multispectral imagery
	•	Classification using object-based and pixel-based approaches
	4.	Vegetation Health Monitoring
	•	NDVI, GNDVI, and Red Edge indices computation
	•	Time-series comparison pre- and post-renaturation


### Sensor Deployment Team

Complementing the remote sensing analysis, the sensor team deployed in-situ environmental sensors to monitor local conditions in real time. Variables collected include:
	•	Air Temperature
	•	Relative Humidity
	•	Ultraviolet Radiation (UV Index)
	•	Ambient Light (Illuminance)
	•	Soil Temperature
	•	Soil Moisture

All sensors were georeferenced and integrated with spatial layers for further cross-domain analysis.


### Dissemination and Public Engagement Team

The dissemination team documented the full research and deployment process through:
	•	High-resolution photography and videography
	•	Annotated field reports and narratives
	•	Development of a web-based platform for publishing observations and visualizations

Their work ensures that both technical findings and societal impact are made accessible to broader audiences, including local stakeholders and the public.
